Introduction
============

Fredrik Wikstrom released the source code to AmiSoundED 0.12 in 2009 because
he did not have had time or motivation to work on this program for a while
(partly because he has been busy with other more interesting projects like f.e.
SRec) but also because they might be useful for someone developing programs for
AmigaOS4.

In 2017, I, Alexandre Balaban, started working on the sources to add features I
missed. I wanted to share my modifications publically, so I contacted Fredrik
and he kindly granted me the permission to put the source code on GitHub.

He choosed to publish the sources using the GPLv2 licence. As such we are bound
to respect this licence terms.


Disclaimer
==========

Whereas the source code originally was trying to retain source level
compatibility with AmigaOS 3, this is not my main concern. I own several
machines running AmigaOS 4 and this is my main (and only) hobby operating
system.


Usage
=====

In order to build AmiSoundED itself, you need the latest AmigaOS SDK. Building
using cross-compilation should be possible but is not guarantee to succeed. I
am developing natively so do not contact me to know how to do it.

To build AmiSoundED, you simply need to cd into the source directory and type
make from a standard Shell. The executable resulting from the compilation will
be put into the 'AmiSoundED' sub-directory. That directory is what is packed up
for a binary distribution.

Some plugins that were released separately like OGG, WavPack and MP3 are also
included in that repository. They use their own Makefiles. To build them just
cd into their directories and type make as above.

F.e. to build the MP3 plugin:
cd plugins/mp3
make
